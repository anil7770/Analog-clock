ANALOG CLOCK USING HTML , CSS , JAVA-SCRIPT 
steps to create a simple analog clock project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

Set Up Project Structure: Create a new directory for your project and add three files: index.html, style.css, and script.js.

HTML Structure: Define the basic structure of the HTML document. Use <div> elements to represent the clock face and hands. Add spans for hour markers.

CSS Styling: Style the clock face, hands, and markers using CSS. Set up the layout, colors, and dimensions according to your design preferences.

JavaScript Logic: Write JavaScript code to fetch the current time and calculate the rotation angles for each hand (hour, minute, and second). Update the rotation of each hand accordingly.

Link CSS: Link the style.css file to your HTML document using the <link> tag in the <head> section.

Link JavaScript: Link the script.js file to your HTML document using the <script> tag at the end of the <body> section to ensure it loads after the HTML content.

Define CSS Variables: Define CSS variables for hand colors and lengths to enable dynamic styling.

Animate Hands: Use CSS transitions or JavaScript to animate the rotation of the hands smoothly.

Calculate Time: Use JavaScript's Date object to get the current time (hours, minutes, and seconds).

Calculate Rotation: Calculate the rotation angles for each hand based on the current time.

Update Hands: Use JavaScript to update the rotation of each hand element based on the calculated rotation angles.

Testing: Test your clock application in different browsers and screen sizes to ensure it works correctly and looks good.

Refinement: Refine your design and code as needed to improve performance, accessibility, and user experience.

Optimization: Optimize your code and assets for faster loading times and better efficiency.

Deployment: Once satisfied, deploy your analog clock project to a web server or hosting platform to make it accessible online.
